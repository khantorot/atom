			Atom Hackathon event is an interdisciplinary approach to come up with ideas and to design radical alternatives on current problems considering the way we work and live. Therefore, hacking can be seen as a tool to deal with challenges and solve them by optimizing existing conditions. It has become clear that new concepts can´t provide universal answers for every problem, but rather have to react on a contemporary state, to deconstruct processes, disrupt and transform the status quo. Hacking is no longer just a way to intervene in the digital space, but to redefine collaborative processes, objects, rooms, buildings, software tools and new civic ideas. 

			The tomorrow’s most successful companies are driven by curiosity and creativity. It´s the turn for everything from how we learn, to how we work where we live by leading to a shift away from efficiency, doing the same thing over and over, only a little bit better. Curiosity is the fuel leading to some of the most innovative and game-changing ideas and products of the time. We are live in a phase where individual talent, creativity and continuous innovation are essential. We should be thinking in terms of ‘return on inspiration and create a new driver for the economy. Disruptive changes to business models will have a profound impact on the workplace landscape over the coming years. The will to innovate requires communicate, experience and transparency in further space patterns. Creative innovation needs agility and performance of both product and space. The blueprint of this spaces are typologies like labs, co-working spaces, speed factories and shared workshops and the digital twin in the virtual world. In fast moving markets established corporations are challenged by dynamic newcomers and startups. They need to change the way they make create, collaborate and make decisions. The goal is to empower the employees more and more, that hey we’ll be able to accelerate the speed at which they do business.”
